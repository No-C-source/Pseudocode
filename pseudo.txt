Task 1
1.	User enters a positive number (or zero (0) to stop)
2.	If the first number entered by user is zero (0), print “No largest number is available”. Then stop process
3.	If the first number entered by user is positive, track and save as the “largest number entered”
4.	Use the “do-while loop” to repeatedly request user to enter a different number
5.	If the number 0 is entered, don’t ask for more numbers.
6.	If the number is greater than the “largest number entered”, replace and save new number as “largest number entered”
7.	When user enters zero (0), stop process.
8.	Show the result “The largest number entered is [the largest number]”.

Task 2
1.	Request user: “Please enter your first name:”
2.	Store the username in a variable tagged as “first_name”
3.	Print / display on screen: “[first_name], Hello, World”

Task 3
1.	Request user to enter a number
2.	Initialise a list to store the entered numbers
3.	Use a loop to repeatedly ask the user: “Do you want to enter another number?”
•	If user answers yes, request and store the number in the list
•	If user answers no, exit the loop
4.	If no numbers were entered, print “No numbers were entered.”
5.	If numbers were entered, calculate the total sum of the numbers in the list
6.	Count how many numbers are in the list. 
7.	Divide the total sum by the count to calculate the arithmetic average.
8.	Show the average to the user.

Task 4
1.	Generate a list tagged TotalGroceries
2.	Followed by a list tagged GroceriesBought
3.	Followed by a list tagged NotYetBought for each item in TotalGroceries
    IF the item is not tagged in GroceriesBought ADD the item to NotYetBought
4.	Sort NotYetBought in alphabetical order
5.	Display groceries NotYetBought in NotYetBought category

Task 5
1.	Process STARTS
2.	Read the two numbers captured by the user (called X and Y)
3.1	Calculate the sum of two numbers X plus Y to determine S. Set S = X + Y
3.2	Calculate the average of S by dividing S with 2 to determine A. Set A = S/2
3.3	Multiply the two numbers X with Y determine the product (P). Set P = X x Y
4.	Display the values of S, A, and P.
5.	Process STOPS.
